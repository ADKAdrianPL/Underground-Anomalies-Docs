- ACT 1
    1.  Michał (coming from mikha’el, which apparently means "alike to God") **\[surname here\]**(either "Narutowicz" after Gabriel Narutowicz and to make a "Naruto" joke, "Stańczyk" after the jester and painting, or "Zawadzki after Tadeusz "Zośka" Zawadzki"; maybe a reference to Rafał Gan-Ganowicz the anti-communist mercenary)

- ACT 2
    1.  "the sentinel" ("Zorza Anna Jagiellonka" as a name maybe, in reference to the slavic goddess of sunrise "Zorza", and to the two polish woman kings Jadwiga Andegaweńska and Anna Jagiellonka maybe)
