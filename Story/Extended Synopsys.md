## Series

- Underground Anomalies is a game about how people (individuals and groups) survive under hostile or unfortunate circumstances.
- Its story is *loosely* based on SCP lore, [The Scarlet King](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-231), [CODE NAME: ████ ███ - The Truth](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/code-name-the-truth), and [SCP-5000](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5000) in particular.

### main game

Note the Act-based structure

1.  The Individual (Dark souls 3 style checkpoint reusing, but linear, levels)
    
    1.  The game opens on a massive ship as it's crashing on a planet (alternate earth, but it's not that important), from the perspective of our main character.
    2.  Meet Michał, a software engineer. He just landed an escape pod on the surface on an alien planet with air that is not breatheable, as well as fauna and flora that is not edible, assuming they're not processed.
    3.  Also meet the space suit's advisory AI, which recomends taking shelter in a nearby cave, and exploring it. The vicinity is scanned for survivours in the meanwhile.
    4.  He explores the cave and finds the High-Mobility Combat Suit (tentative name), the game now teaches the variable height jump to the player.
    5.  Now Michał is made aware that there is a scientist trapped deeper in the cave system, so he sets out. Fighting bosses
2.  The Groups (dark souls 1 / hollow knight interconnected world)
    
    1.  the world is split upinto different sections representing different forms of government
3.  The Trauma (100% completion good ending, basically just an extended final boss / gauntlet)

### immediatly after that (final dlc) (honestly re-thinking this one)

the founding of a nation; scavenging (the binding of isaac, with the progression system of 20 mins till dawn, and the base menaging of mgsv for perma upgrades)

1.  after beating everything in the last game, the people who filled the power vaccum left behind are running out of recources. the only anwser is an anomalous one featuring rougelite gameplay.
2.  player power takes
    1.  permanent upgrades gained through the base menagment
    2.  consumables that are also the very resources you seek
    3.  the 20 mins till dawn style leveling, with the featured upgrades based around the previous game's dlc characters, making a couple designed builds per character

* * *

### years later (sequel one "Underwater Anomalies" (negative altitudes with positive attitudes?))

the two nations; war (basically a roark's aot / arcade-y flight sim singleplayer campaign)  
you could do this by putting the player character in various "waterframes" that would be penguin-themed (adelie, emperor, so on)

1.  a nation is found underwater, hostilities ensue

### millenia later (sequel two "Underworld Anomalies")

the species; ["Souls-like" + "Fighting Game" hybrid](../../../undefined)

* * *

### eons later (sequel three "Undernight Anomalies")

the world; [Game Idea-lets](../../../undefined), the Furi inspired one, specificaly

1.  the sun has went out at this point, it's death was parried but not reversed
