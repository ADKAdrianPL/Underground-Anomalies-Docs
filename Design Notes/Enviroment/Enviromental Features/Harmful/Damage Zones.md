### An area that damages the character entering it.

- There are two kinds of damage zones:
	1. Damage over time; the character's Health is constantly drained at a set rate. Used for punishing platforming mistakes, and no-go zones.
 	2. Single hit; the character is damaged once on contact, mimicking the [Base Enemy](Enemies/Base%20Enemy.md). Used for hazardous zones, traversable by [Slash Bouncing](../../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md).
