- This unavoidable power-up is given to the player shortly after a basic movement tutorial section, enabling the ammount of mobility the rest of the game was designed around.
    - Enables the [Jump's](../../../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) variable height functionality.
    - Changes the character's movement configuration values:
        | Movement Variable | Original Value | Target Value |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | Gravity Scale | 1.0 | 2.0 |
        | Jump Height | 90.0 | 430.0 |
        | Max Walk Speed | 350 | 550 |
        | Max Acceleration | 2048.0 | 7168.0 |
        | Air Control | 0.05 | 1.0 |
        | Ground Friction | 8.0 | 10.0 |
        | Falling Lateral Friction | 0.0 | 7.5 |
- Notes
    - At one point in development, the speed and jump height increases were one power-up, while the additional air control used for more precise jumps was another;<br>
the two were folded into one to allow for more gameplay complexity within the small number of levels this project has.
