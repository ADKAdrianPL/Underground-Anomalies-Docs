This type of power-up grants an arbitrary list of abilities (or a single ability) to the player character, when it comes into contact. Every instance of this type of power-up is unavoidable; either put directly in the player's way, or right before an obstacle that is otherwise impossible to avoid.

- The abilities provided this way include:
  1. [Slash](../../../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md), [Parry](../../../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Parry.md), [Slice Stance](../../../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slice%20Stance.md), and [Heal](../../../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Heal.md) in [Sword Intro](../../../Levels/Sword%20Intro.md).
  2. [Dash](../../../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Dash.md) in [Mobility Suite](../../../Levels/Mobility%20Suite.md).
