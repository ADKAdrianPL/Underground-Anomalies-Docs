###  An area that ends the level, allowing the player to move on to the next one or return to the main menu, when the player character enters it.

Located in the middle of a long descent in every level apart from [the last level](../../Levels/Growth.md), where the level exit is instead activated by defeating [the final boss](../Harmful/Enemies/Growth.md).
