### A tutorial for basic combat. 

1. [Parry](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Parry.md) introduction.
	1. A [Turret](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Turret.md) fires from the far end of a corridor in bursts, preventing the player from progressing further until the [Ability Giving Power-up](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Power-ups/Ability%20Giving.md) in the room is picked up; it contains the [Slash](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md), [Slice Stance](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slice%20Stance.md), and [Parry](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Parry.md) abilities.<br>The last one is the tool needed to go through the projectile filled hallway.
2. [Slash Bounce](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) introduction.
	1. The [Turret](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Turret.md) hallway opens into a shaft with two exits, and a [Damage Over Time Zone](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Damage%20Zones.md) on the bottom.
	2. The upper exit leads to a room with a platform, and a [Stat Increase Power-up](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Power-ups/Stat%20Increases.md) tucked into a corner.
	3. The only way forward is to reach an opening on the other side of the room, which is too high to [Jump]() to from the ground and too far to just [Jump]() to from the platform.<br>slash bouncing off of a [Single Hit Zone]()
	4. The next room has a similar setup, requiring consecutive [Slash Bounces](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) off of floating [Base Enemies](), over a pit of crawlies with a stat increase.
3. Slice stance one blob encounter
4. [Slash Bounce](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) continued.
	1. Next up is a challenge consisting of turrets above platforms with crawlies, and a slash bounce off of a slow projectile
