### A tutorial for basic combat. 

1. [Parry](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Parry.md) introduction.
	1. A [Turret](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Turret.md) fires from the far end of a corridor in bursts, preventing the player from progressing further until the [Ability Giving Power-up](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Power-ups/Ability%20Giving.md) in the room is picked up; it contains the [Slash](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md), [Slice Stance](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slice%20Stance.md), and [Parry](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Parry.md) abilities.<br>The last one is the tool needed to go through the projectile filled hallway.
2. [Slash Bounce](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) introduction.
	1. The [Turret](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Turret.md) hallway opens into a shaft with two exits, and a [Damage Over Time Zone](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Damage%20Zones.md) on the bottom.
	2. The upper exit leads to a room with a platform, and a [Stat Increase Power-up](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Power-ups/Stat%20Increases.md) tucked into a corner.
	3. The only way forward is to reach an opening on the other side of the room, which is too high to [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) to from the ground and too far to just [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) to from the platform.<br>This forces the player to learn [Slash Bouncing](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) off of the example of a large [Single Hit Zone](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Damage%20Zones.md).
	4. The next room has a similar setup, requiring consecutive [Slash Bounces](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) off of floating [Base Enemies](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Base%20Enemy.md), over a pit of crawlies with a [Stat Increase Power-up](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Power-ups/Stat%20Increases.md) in the corner.<br>There is a [Checkpoint](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Checkpoint.md) on the platform leading to the next room.
3. [Slice Stance](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) introduction.
	1. A big open room, closed off by an [Enemy Door](../Enviromental%20Features/Neutral/Enemy%20Door.md) tied to a [Blob](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Blob.md).<br>The [Enemy Door](../Enviromental%20Features/Neutral/Enemy%20Door.md) forces the player to defeat the [Blob](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Blob.md), which itself encourages them to use the [Slice Stance](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) with its high Health and easily [Parryable](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) attack; the high Health makes defeating it with just [Slashes](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) a bit tedious, while the attack gives the player an easy way to generate energy.
5. [Slash Bounce](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) continued.
	1. A vertical shaft filled with [Base Enemies](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Base%20Enemy.md) leads to this level's last platforming segment:
	2. A challenge consisting of [Turrets](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Turret.md) above two platforms with [Crawlies](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Crawlies.md), separated by a gap requiring a [Slash Bounce](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) off of a slow, [Slash Bounce](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md)-able [Turret Projectile](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Turret.md).<br>A [Checkpoint](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Checkpoint.md) is provided ahead of another mandatory fight.
6. [Slice Stance](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) continued.
	1. A similar room to the first [Blob](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Blob.md) encounter, also closed off by an [Enemy Door](../Enviromental%20Features/Neutral/Enemy%20Door.md).<br>The way it differs from its predecessor is that it contains two [Blobs](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Blob.md) instead of one, reinforcing already established concepts.<br>The [Enemy Door](../Enviromental%20Features/Neutral/Enemy%20Door.md) opens into the [Level End's](../Enviromental%20Features/Neutral/Level%20End.md) pit.
