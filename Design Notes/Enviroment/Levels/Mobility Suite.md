### More difficult platforming challenges.

1. Entrance
	1. A short tunnel with a [Checkpoint](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Checkpoint.md) placed below a hole in the ceiling, and ahead of two pits separated by a barrier protruding from the top of the passage. The first pit leads to the next segment.<br>The [Checkpoint](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Checkpoint.md) here is the only one in this level, it's useful multiple times however, due to the layout of the level circling back on itself.
2. Double Jump
	1. A short hallway leads into a big room with small floating platforms above a [Damage over Time Zone](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Damage&20Zones.md). The only platform that the player will recognize as reachable has an unavoidable [Double Jump Power-up](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Power-ups/Double&20Jump.md) on it.
	2. The next platform has a button prompt for [Jumping](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) to clue the player in to the fact that they can now [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) to previously inaccessible places. That platform requires [Jumping](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) in mid-air at the peak of a [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) from where the [Double Jump Power-up](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Power-ups/Double&20Jump.md) was obtained to be reached.
	3. The only way forward is a platform behind a barrier protruding from the side, requireing the player to [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) at an angle and [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) mid-air at a different angle.
	4. There is a [Stat Increase](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Power-ups/Stat&20Increases) available by [Jumping](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) to it, before [Jumping](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) backward onto the platform that was just leaped from, reinforcing the concept from the previous segment.<br>The way to progress is a platform directly above the one the player is currently standing on, requiring a mid-air [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) both at the peak of a normal [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) and at a different angle from it, a combination of the two previous segments.
	5. The path to the next platform is blocked by a barrier, the only way past which is to [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) under it; a new and important concept presented in a simple form.
 	6. â€“> double jump, bounce, mid-air jump, bounce backward and mid-air jump to a hole in the wall, leading to a shaft that drops the player next to the [Checkpoint](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Checkpoint.md)
3. Back at the entrance
	1. double jump under the barrier
4. Dash
	1. thread the needle
	2. regular
	3. bounce
	4. under barrier
	5. bounce around barrier, then more bounces into exit
5. Last visit to the entrance
	1. double jump under the barrier, dash over the pit to level end
