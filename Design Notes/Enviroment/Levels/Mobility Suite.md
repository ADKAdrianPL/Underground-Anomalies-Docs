### More difficult platforming challenges.

1. Entrance
	1. A short tunnel with a [Checkpoint](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Checkpoint.md) placed below a hole in the ceiling, and ahead of two pits separated by a barrier protruding from the top of the passage. The first pit leads to the next segment.<br>The [Checkpoint](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Checkpoint.md) here is the only one in this level, it's useful multiple times however, due to the layout of the level circling back on itself.
2. Double Jump
	1. A short hallway leads into a big room with small floating platforms above a [Damage over Time Zone](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Damage%20Zones.md). The only platform that the player will recognize as reachable has an unavoidable [Double Jump Power-up](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Power-ups/Double%20Jump.md) on it.
	2. The next platform has a button prompt for [Jumping](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) to clue the player in to the fact that they can now [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) to previously inaccessible places. That platform requires [Jumping](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) in mid-air at the peak of a [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) from where the [Double Jump Power-up](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Power-ups/Double%20Jump.md) was obtained to be reached.
	3. The only way forward is a platform behind a barrier protruding from the side, requireing the player to [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) at an angle and [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) mid-air at a different angle.
	4. There is a [Stat Increase](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Power-ups/Stat%20Increases) available by [Jumping](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) to it, before [Jumping](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) backward onto the platform that was just leaped from, reinforcing the concept from the previous segment.<br>The way to progress is a platform directly above the one the player is currently standing on, requiring a mid-air [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) both at the peak of a normal [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) and at a different angle from it, a combination of the two previous segments.
	5. The path to the next platform is blocked by a barrier, the only way past which is to [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) under it; a new and important concept presented in a simple form.
 	6. The last part of this segment consists of a chain of challanges leading to a hole opening into a shaft that drops the player next to the [Checkpoint](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Checkpoint.md).<br>The player has to [Double Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) up to a [Base Enemy](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Base%20Enemy.md) to [Slash Bounce](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) off of, mid-air [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) to another [Base Enemy](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Base%20Enemy.md) to [Slash Bounce](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) off of, now with enough height to reach the exit behind them with one last mid-air [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md).
3. Back at the entrance
	1. The barrier separating the two pits can now be avoided by [Jumping](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) at it and mid-air [Jumping](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) past it once the player character is just under it.<br>This allows the player to fall into the second pit, leading to the next segment.
4. Dash
	1. This segment begins with an introduction to the [Dash](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Dash.md) ability, given by an unavoidable [Ability Giving Power-up](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Power-ups/Ability%20Giving.md). In the hallway there is a small pit with a [Damage over Time Zone](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Damage%20Zones.md) at the bottom; the hallway is separated into two halves by a wall with an opening just big enough for the player character to fit through, with [Base Enemies](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Base%20Enemy.md) lining its edges.<br>All the player has to do here is stand at the edge of the pit, look through the opening in the wall, and press the [Dash](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Dash.md) button. The other half of this hallway opens into a very large room, which houses the rest of this segment's challenges.
	2. These challenges start basic, with a platform requiring both the height gained from a [Double Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md), and the distance from a [Dash](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Dash.md) for the player to reach it.
	3. The next one platform requires a [Double Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) and a [Dash](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Dash.md) to reach a [Base Enemy](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Base%20Enemy.md), a [Slash Bounce](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) off of that [Base Enemy](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Base%20Enemy.md), and a mid-air [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md).
	4. The second to last part of this segment requires [Jumping](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) and [Dashing](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Dash.md) below a barrier, followed by a mid-air [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) onto a platform.
	5. This segment's last challenge requires three mid-air [Jumps](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md), leading into [Dashes](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Dash.md), and then into [Slash Bounces](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) off of [Base Enemies](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Base%20Enemy.md), and then one last mid-air [Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) and [Dash](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Dash.md) onto a platform; the platform allows the player to access the shaft that drops the player next to the [Checkpoint](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Checkpoint.md).
5. Last visit to the entrance
	1. The barrier separating the two pits can again be avoided by [Jumping](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) at it and mid-air [Jumping](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) past it; the subsequent pit can now be [Dashed](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Dash.md) over.<br>Past that lies the shaft with the [Level End](../Enviromental%20Features/Neutral/Level%20End.md).
