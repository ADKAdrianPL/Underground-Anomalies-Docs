### A tutorial for basic traversal.

1. Basic Jump
	1. The level starts with the player character in a crater, facing the entrance to a cave.
	2. The enterance is blocked by three rocks accompanied by a button prompt for [Jumping](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md); only one of the rocks is small enough for the temporarily underpowered player character to jump over, making the player aware of their current limitations.<br>A [Stat Increase Power-up](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Power-ups/Stat%20Increases.md) is concealed by one of the rocks, rewarding a player that looks at their surroundings.
	3. There is a small hole in the path forward that the player character can only cross by jumping from near its edge, teaching the player that jumping from farther away may not be effective enough for some jumps.
	4. Another hole, one too big for the player character to jump across, leads the player to a corridor at the end of which the [General Mobility Power-up](../Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Power-ups/General%20Mobility.md) is placed.
2. Hightened Mobility
