### A final challenge combining platforming and combat. 

1. First phase
	1. The level starts on a platform overlooking a big tunnel with a large [Single Hit Damage Zone](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Damage%20Zones.md) on the bottom.
	2. Reaching the next platform requires repeated [Slash Bounces](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) off of the [Single Hit Damage Zone](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Damage%20Zones.md); the entire tunnel is at a downward angle to facilitate this, allowing the player to look down past the 45 degree threshold for [Slash Bouncing](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md).
	3. The first fight platform has two [Tentacles](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Tentacle.md), bound to an [Enemy Door](../Enviromental%20Features/Neutral/Enemy%20Door.md).
2. Second phase
	1. When the player leaves the [Tentacles'](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Tentacle.md) platform in the direction of the final platform, two rapid fire [Turrets](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Turret.md) positioned there start aiming and shooting at the character.<br>The player is required to use the [Dash](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Dash.md) and [Double Jump](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Jump.md) to dodge a spray of projectiles, while [Slash Bouncing](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) across the [Single Hit Damage Zone](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Damage%20Zones.md).
	2. The final platform has two [Tentacles](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Tentacle.md), like the previous one, in addition to two [Turrets](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Turret.md).<br>All of them being destroyed sends a signal to a hidden [Level End](../Enviromental%20Features/Neutral/Level%20End.md); doing so requires mechanical skill as well as proficiency in threat management from the player, to destroy the [Tentacles](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Tentacle.md) while dodging [Turret](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Turret.md) fire before advancing on and destroying the [Turrets](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Turret.md) themselves.
