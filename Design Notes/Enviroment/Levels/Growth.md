### A final challenge combining platforming and combat.

	1. The level starts on a platform overlooking a big tunnel with a large [Single Hit Damage Zone](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Damage%20Zones.md) on the bottom.

Reaching the next platform requires repeated [Slash Bounces](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md) off of the [Single Hit Damage Zone](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Damage%20Zones.md); the entire tunnel is at a downward angle to facilitate this, allowing the player to look down past the 45 degree threshold for [Slash Bouncing](../../Player%20Character/Ultion/Abilities/Slash.md).
	3. The first fight platform has two [Tentacles](../Enviromental%20Features/Harmful/Enemies/Tentacle.md), bound to an [Enemy Door](../Enviromental%20Features/Neutral/Enemy%20Door.md).
