This type of power-up grants an arbitrary list of abilities (or a single ability) to the player character, when it comes into contact. Every instance of this type of power-up is unavoidable; either put directly in the player's way, or right before an obstacle that is otherwise impossible to avoid.

-  The abilities provided this way include:
  1. [Slash](../Ablities/Slash.md), [Parry](../Ablities/Parry.md), [Slice Stance](../Ablities/Slice%20Stance.md), and [Heal](../Ablities/Heal.md)
  2. [Dash](../Ablities/Dash.md)
