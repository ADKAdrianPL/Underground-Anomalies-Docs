The Default PCV  
Inspired mostly by [Hollow Knight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/), with [Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/235460/METAL_GEAR_RISING_REVENGEANCE/) and a little bit of [RWBY's Adam Taurus' Moonslice](https://rwby.fandom.com/wiki/Moonslice) sprincled on.  
(Also maybe some Symphony of the Night?)  
Musical calling cards: wooden kazoo, whatever sounds a sabre would make as an instrument, that bass thing from Crazy Chicken kart: thunder's beijing sound track and castlevania's lament of innocence
