- AnyDamage (Debug or DamageOverTime?)
- PointDamage (ContactDamage from Enemies or Projectiles)
    - Apply [Knockback](../../../Underground%20Anomalies/Design%20Notes/PC%20Variations/Ultion/Abilities/Knockback.md) away from the source of damage (Actor)

Maybe instead of determining the reaction to damage by whether it was PointDamage or not, it could be instead determined by DamageType?
