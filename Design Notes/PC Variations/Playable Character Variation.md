The code for this project's player character is structured in a way that facilitates the addition of alternate player character's. This is done through inheritence; a "base character" class defines the functions that every character would need to function that a "specific character" class could then build off of.

This is unused due to time constraints. Other variations of the player character have been conceptualized but only one was implemented: Ultion (an obsolete english word, borrowed from latin, meaning "revenge" or "vengance").
