### Underground Anomalies' gameplay loop centers around a powerful player character with a variety of abilities, all designed for two purposes: Traversal and Combat.

Traversal involves navigating linear obstacle courses consisting of enviromental hazards, collectables, and enemies.<br>
Combat revolves around generating Energy by defensive play, and spending it on damaging offensive actions.

The goal for both of those is getting a new ability to use in the next challange.
