Underground Anomalies' gameplay loop centers around a powerful player character with a variety of abilities, all designed for two purposes: Traversal and Combat. The goal for both of those is getting a new ability to use in the next challange.

Traversal involves navigating linear obstacle courses consisting of enviromental hazards, collectables, and enemies.

Combat revolves around generating Energy by defensive play, and spending it on damaging offensive actions.
