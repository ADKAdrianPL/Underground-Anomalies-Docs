An enemy that floats in the air and shoots in a single direction, periodicaly.

Variations may include: different rate of fire, whether or not to aim for the player.

If a more passive wall turret is ultimately decided upon, it would technically be less of an "enemy" and closer to being classified as an "enviromental hazard"
