A slow but tanky gelatin-like mass that slowly chases the player and tries to pounce on them when they get in range.

the purpose of this enemy is to provide the player with an enemy that is best killed with [Slice Stance](../../../Underground%20Anomalies/Design%20Notes/PC%20Variations/Ultion/Abilities/Slice%20Stance.md) and has an easily [Parried](../../../Underground%20Anomalies/Design%20Notes/PC%20Variations/Ultion/Abilities/Parry.md) attack.

Maybe instead of just having this enemy encourage rapid slicing by having a lot of health, it'd be better for it to have regenerating armor that can't be out-damaged outside of slowed time  
or maybe have both in the form of "blob" and "stale blob"  
if so, then replace the double blob encounter with stale ones and the single one with a regenerating one  
or maybe just add a "regen rate" variable to the base_enemy
