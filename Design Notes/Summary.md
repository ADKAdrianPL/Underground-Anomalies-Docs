Underground Anomalies is a First-Person Melee Combat Platformer about survival in harsh enviroments, inspired most by games from the 7th generation of consoles (better games were released before and after, but the general state of the industry has never been better besides maybe the accessibility of tools).

maybe it should be a third-person game instead?

The story is loosely inspired by SCP lore, [The Truth](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/code-name-the-truth) and [The Scarlet King](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tuftos-proposal) in particular. You play as a crash survivor of a faster than light starship designed to explore beyond the observable universe, exploring a cave system on an alien world in search of any of his colleagues in a special suit of armor with a saber attached.

The base game will have one [variation of the playable character](../../Underground%20Anomalies/Design%20Notes/PC%20Variations/Playable%20Character%20Variation.md) and two difficulty settings (a standard one and an unlockable "max health of everything is halved or all damage is doubled" one), with DLC adding more difficulty modifiers for free, as well as more [Playable Character Variations](../../Underground%20Anomalies/Design%20Notes/PC%20Variations/Playable%20Character%20Variation.md) for a fee.

The final game would have multiple save files (like dark souls or ultrakill), but the demo will only have one
