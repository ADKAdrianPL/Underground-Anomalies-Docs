    1.  The character Jumps.
    2.  The Ability is Ended when the input is let go of.
        1.  If the character hasn't reached the max jump height yet, upward momentum is stopped.
- Notes:
    - The player is allowed to stop ascending mid-jump to provide more precise control over the character.
    - The variable jump height functionality is only enabled after the player collects the [General Mobility Power-up](../../../Enviroment/Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Power-ups/General%20Mobility.md). Without it the jump only stops at max height, even if the button is released sooner.
    - Jumping again in the air can be enabled by collecting the [Double Jump](../../../Enviroment/Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Power-ups/Double%20Jump.md) power-up.
