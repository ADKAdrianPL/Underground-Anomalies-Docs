A simple form of melee attack. A moderately long cooldown and low damage are offset by the lack of an Energy cost.

    1.  An area in front of the character is defined for the duration of the ability, in which:
        1.  Damage is applied to every enemy hit.
        2.  If the character is looking down, they are launched into the air. This is referred to as a Slash-bounce.
    2.  After the amount of time defined in the Duration, the ability is ended.
- Notes:
    - The input for this ability is hijacked by [Slice Stance](Slice%20Stance.md).
    - Slash-bouncing reenables the character's [Double Jump](Jump.md), and [Dash](Dash.md).
