### A burst of mobility.

A quick and short lateral movement, unaffected by gravity, the purpose of which is to add complexity to exploration and combat.

- Obtained from the first/second [Ability Giving Power-up](../../../Enviroment/Enviromental%20Features/Helpful/Power-ups/Ability%20Giving.md) in the [Mobility Suite Level](../../../Enviroment/Levels/Mobility%20Suite.md).
- Default Inputs: (Instant)
    - Mouse and Keyboard: Left Shift
    - Controller: Left Trigger
- Effect: (Duration: 0.225s | Cooldown: 1.5s)
    1. Gravity is disabled for the character.
    2. A constant force is applied to the character, in the direction it's moving in (or forward if its stationary).
    3. The constant force is removed and gravity is re-enabled after 0.225s, thus ending the ability.
    4. The cooldown begins.
- Notes:
    - This ability can only be used once before the relatively long cooldown, to disincentivize the player from being overly reliant on it to dodge attacks instead of [Parry](Parry.md)ing them; it doesn't provide invulnerability for the same reason.
    - The player character can dash only once in mid-air before landing; the only acception to this is if the ability is "recharged" by bouncing off of an enemy with the [Slash](Slash.md).
