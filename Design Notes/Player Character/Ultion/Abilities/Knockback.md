### A punishment for getting hit.

Technically "getting _Knockback_-ed"; a reaction to receiving damage from colliding with an enemy, an attack, or select hazards.

- Inherent.
- Effect: (Duration: 0.8s | Cooldown: 1.25s\*)
    1.  Input is disabled.
    2.  The character is Launched away from the assailant at an upward angle.
    3.  After 0.8s: input is enabled, and the ability is ended.
- Notes:
    - Not to be confused with [Slash's](Slash.md) Pushback.
    - \*The character can only take the relevant kinds of damage once every 1.25s, due to the temporary invincibility granted on hit.
