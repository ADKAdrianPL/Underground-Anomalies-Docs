## An Ability is an action that a character can perform, that may be canceled or blocked by other happenings.

### Short description.

A summary of the ability's function, as well as its purpose within the game, with pseudo code below.

- Obtainment method.
- Default Inputs: (Instant / Toggle / Toggle, Hold)  
    _While "Instant" is relatively self-explanitory (pressing a button activates the ability), "Toggle" is a bit counter-intuitive.  
    It doesn't necessarily mean that one press of a button activates the ability and another one is required to turn it off.  
    Because of the near identical implementation, "Toggle" could also mean that pressing the button turns it on and letting go of it turns it off; This is denoted by adding ", Hold" after "Toggle" ("Toggle, Hold")._
    - Mouse and Keyboard:
    - Controller:
- Effect: \[Duration: X.XXs / Varies | Cooldown: X.XXs\]  
    _Duration is how long an ability stays active after activation.  
    Cooldown is how often an ability can be activated, independent from duration._
    - Description of what happens within the ability's duration, after the button is pressed and the ability is successfully activated.
- Notes:
    - Additional, miscellaneous notes reagarding the ability in question.
    - All abilities prevent the activation of another instance of itself.
