A Playable Character Variation is functionaly, a different player controlled character with different [Abilities](:/121ebaf342f14e1c8fae17ff68dd0e76).
Note that since the mechanics change, and the world is built around the mechanics, the world will also have to change somewhat to "fit" different PCV's movesets.

- Currently conceptualized PCVs include:
    - [Ultion](../Summary.md)
    - Chronograph
        Inspired by [Touhou: Luna Nights'](https://store.steampowered.com/app/851100/Touhou_Luna_Nights/) playable Sakuya, and [Jojo Go Beyond Data Pack's](https://trello.com/b/msnH5Ebg/go-beyonds-epic-trello) interpretation of Epitaph and King Crimson.
