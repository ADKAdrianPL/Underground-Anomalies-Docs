- two layers/halves, a normal cave system but with themed sections (take inspiration from zelda dungeon themes, and the UbiArt rayman games), one more anomalous, dangerous, and more complex (kinda like the secondary worlds in rayman origins. i guess symphony of the night also did something like this with the reverse castle?) also introducing small villiage-sized (think the first town in the witcher 3) alien civilizations
- A small area (like a hallway) that's completely randomly / procedurally generated every time you enter/exit it, among other anomolous shenanigans as the introduction to the lower half of the cave system
- consider giving every area in the game a secret level similar to how ultrakill did it, but instead of themÂ *just* being vehicles for references let them also serve as a sort of one-off testing ground for game concepts that could work in the same setting/universe
